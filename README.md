# P2 - Create an xkcd Password Generator

Live URL: http://p2.kidcoder.me/

Description: This is a xkcd password generator that creates 5 passwords for the user to 
choose from. The user also has the option to choose from 4 inputs to generate a custom
password. They can determine the number of words, the character that links each word,
and add a symbol and/or a number to the end of the password.

Note: The HTML and CSS for the project was written by me. I did however modify my
function that uses a DOM Parser to pull down a long dictionary of words and export
them as a plain text array. The original code can be found here:
